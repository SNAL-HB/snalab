  While the COVID-19 pandemic continues its global devastation, numerous accompanying challenges emerge. One important challenge is to efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic. An infodemic is an overabundance of information – some accurate and some not – occurring during an epidemic. Rampant conspiracy theories, disinformation, misinformation, and various types of scams can spread fast by taking advantage of human gullibility, fear, and ignorance. Therefore, there is a pressing need to manage the infodemic to help people find trustworthy information and reliable guidance during this global public health crisis. AI for Good holds a lot of potential for solving societal problems including combating the infodemic, while challenges remain. It is important to integrate theories from different disciplines to help with the COVID-19 crisis.

In this special issue, we provide an interdisciplinary forum for researchers and practitioners to combat the COVID-19 infodemic. We expect novel research to study the understanding, detection, mitigation, and measurement of the COVID-19 infodemic and potential future outbreaks. To facilitate further research in COVID-19 infodemic, this special issue  welcomes interdisciplinary research articles, new open access datasets, repositories, and benchmarks, broadening research on crisis informatics and its development.

## Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Disinformation/misinformation detection and mitigation
- Fact-checking and credibility assessment  
- Computational tools to understand, measure and contain infodemic
- Diffusion and intervention of infodemic
- Bias, transparency, and fairness
- Economical impacts of infodemic  
- Infodemic monitoring across countries, regions, and cultures
- Individual and societal impacts of COVID-19 infodemic
- Epidemiology, public health, and infodemic
- Psychology, marketing and behavioural insights
- Data science, applied maths and physics for infodemic
- Society, ethics, trust, and governance for infodemic
- Attribution and source tracing of COVID-19 infodemic
- Spatio-temporal infodemic analysis
- Social network analysis  
- AI for COVID-19
- Sociological and psychological analysis of infodemic
- COVID-19 infodemic datasets, benchmarks, and repositories

## Submission Instructions  

Articles reporting original  and  unpublished research  results  pertaining to  the  above topics are solicited. We welcome two types of research contributions:
