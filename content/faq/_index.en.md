{{< faq "What is the goal of this lab?" >}}
Social networks have always been at the center of human interaction, but especially with the explosive growth of the internet, network analysis has become increasingly central to all branches of the social sciences. How do people influence each other, bargain with each other, exchange information (or germs), or interact online? We share experience in learning data mining and visualization as we collaborate to pursue state-of-the-art techniques for visualizing and modeling social networks, as well as a concern for theory and interpretation of the form, variation, and evolution of a broad range of social networks.

{{< faq "What does "experiment + workshop" mean?" >}}
SNA Lab @Harrisburg employs the model of “workshop + experiment,” which allows research fellows to explore various tools, discuss working ideas, and prepare for succeeding projects. Our teams may work under the same topic, but each group or individual may propose and develop their subjects as we progress.

{{< faq "Can I receive fundings for my project?" >}}
This lab is independently run as a group, and we currently have no internal fundings for fellows. If you are looking for funding opportunities for your research projects, we would like to help you identify external fundings during workshop sessions. Also, we may update some funding opportunities in my [Resources](https://snalab.netlify.app/resources/) page.

{{< faq "What is the Code of Ethics of this lab?" >}}
The ethics, and ethical governance, of online research have been much debated, and a number of professional organizations have promulgated guidelines for researchers considering conducting their research online. Although the datasets and tools that we provided are under either Creative Common or Open Access licenses, we encourage you to review potential ethical issues per project and do not release individual user's information without consent or anonymization. You can check our [Resources](https://snalab.netlify.app/resources/) page for ethics discussion and feel free to use our workshop session to address your concerns on ethics. Also, you can consult IRB at your institute.
